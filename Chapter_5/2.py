# Write a program that counts how many of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 100 end in a
# 4 and how many end in a 9.

# count1 = 0
# count2 = 0
# for i in range(1,101):
#     if (i**2)% 10 == 4:
#         count1 = count1 +1
#     if (i**2)% 10 == 9:
#         count2 = count2 +1
# print("Count of 4 end is ", count1)
# print("Count of 9 end is ",count2)
